The Language Hackday is a day-long event primarily geared towards making machines do things with human language, either in text or audio form. It is for anyone interested in using computers to analyse, create, transform, or otherwise play with any of the 6,000 human languages (though the major world languages will be easier to find data on).

This event is for anyone who wants to improve their code. An understanding of JavaScript or Python will help you make the most of the day, but you will be guided through the day by a facilitator and will be pairing up with different partners as well, so don't worry about pressure to perform. Whatever your experience, you'll have the opportunity to think about things in new ways and work with new people.

All you need is your lovely self and a laptop (with its charger).
