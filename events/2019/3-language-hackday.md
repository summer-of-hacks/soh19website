The Language Hackday is a day-long event primarily geared towards making machines do things with human language, either in text or audio form. It is for anyone interested in using computers to analyse, create, transform, or otherwise play with any of the 6,000 human languages (though the major world languages will be easier to find data on).

This event is for anyone who wants to play around with language and programming. An understanding of JavaScript or Python will help you make the most of the day, but there will be many knowledgeable people to help you out if you get stuck, so don't worry about pressure to perform. Whatever your experience, you'll have the opportunity to think about language processing in new ways and work with new people.

> All ages are welcome: it'd be awesome to have some younger hackers—say, aged 6+—bringing
> their smarts and enthusiasm.

Some things that you might find people working on include figuring out if a twitter bot is happy or sad, creating rap poetry as a mashup of Shakespeare and Eminem, or even creating web-based materials to help others learn languages.

All you need is your lovely self and a laptop (with its charger).
