This is a day of hacking on hardware. It's for anyone who is interested in
learning about hardware. There are no minimum entry requirements other than an
inquisitive mind.

If you've never touched a breadboard before, that's fine: we’re bringing some
starter packs, complete with wires and components and all the fun
gizmos and doodads. We'll also have plenty of
helpful people to guide you. If you're a bit more experienced that's great too,
as you'll get to play with some new kit or hack on a project with like-minded people.

> All ages are welcome: it'd be awesome to have some younger hackers—say, aged 6+—bringing
> their smarts and enthusiasm.

You'll probably want to bring a laptop _and its charger_. You're also welcome to
bring any other tools and components you have. We recommend marking them up
somehow—using washi tape, stickers, etc.—so it's easy to check you're taking the
right things home.

Here are the [slides](hardware_hackday_slides.pdf) for the event.
