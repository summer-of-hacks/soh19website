This is a day of hacking on hardware. It's for anyone who is interested in
learning about hardware. There are no minimum entry requirements other than an
inquisitive mind.

If you've never touched a breadboard before, that's fine: we’re bringing some
starter packs, complete with Espruino boards and components and plenty of
helpful people to guide you. If you're a bit more experienced that's great too,
as you'll get to play with some new kit or hack on a project with like-minded people.

You'll probably want to bring a laptop _and its charger_. You're also welcome to
bring any other tools and components you have. We recommend marking them up
somehow—using washi tape, stickers, etc.—so it's easy to check you're taking the
right things home.
